VX by Arturo Filasto' <art@baculo.org>

The main idea behind VX is that it might be fun to play tricks on somebody
trying to crack your WEP protected router.
What we do is we forge data packets that are encrypted with the wrong WEP key
and inject them into the air. The person trying to crack your wireless network
will therefore not crack the real key, but your phony forged one.

This tool was originaly created for the CAT 2011 event in Milan Italy, were teams
competed against each other to crack WEP protected access points and own the machines
behind them.
A requirement was therefore also the necessity to be able to filter the "evil" packets
from the sane ones. This can be easily done by specifying a known source mac address for
the spoofed packets and filtering them out with
  
  tshark -R "(wlan.sa != ${MAC}) && (wlan.da != ${MAC})" -r $FILE  -w clean.cap

Other fun functionality include the ability to spawn an arbitratily large amount of fake
access points by transmitting beacons and data packets and changing just the last bytes of
the MAC address.

Broadcasting fun messages to the air as SSID names.

I have only tested it with a rtl8170 ALFA Networks USB card and also not that much. This
scripts serves mainly as a POC and is not all that robust.

Requirements:
- pylorcon
- scapy

TODO
- Refactor the remaining code in the original script and add it to main
